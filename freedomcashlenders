Consolidate your loans: A direct consolidation loan is an option for borrowers with more than one federal student loan. It combines those outstanding balances into one debt with just one monthly payment.4
Ask for a lower payment: If you’ve received a garnishment notice, you can try contacting your loan servicer directly to renegotiate your loan’s repayment terms. You’ll need to contact them quickly to avoid wage garnishment and make your first payment no later than 30 days after the date on the notice.
