Keeping tabs on your federal student debt and proactively taking steps toward repayment is an absolute necessity if you want to avoid involuntary collections and other consequences. One way or another, your loans have to be repaid (or forgiven), but it’s up to you to decide when and how that’ll happen. If there’s anything you’re unsure about regarding your debt, contact your lender directly for specific details and to ask about resources that can help with your specific situation.
